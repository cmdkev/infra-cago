### About the group
>A high level overview of your breakout group. What problem are you trying to solve? Make this simple and jargon-free. Links are good too!

We are trying to learn about the hyperinvisible backbone of city life -- construction!
Construction and infrastructure are major items on [government budgets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/) and we want to understand which entities are getting these contracts, what types of projects are being completed and what construction laborers are actually doing. 
Where does the money go to? Who benefits from this? 
What systems of accountability are there for the public to tug on? 
Some brainstormy questions:
- Who is doing construction on the Kennedy (I90/94)? When do they think they will finish? What are they doing? 
- Who is building that new group of identical single family homes in Logan Square? 
- Who is building the 43 Green apartments in Bronzeville at the 43rd St. stop?

- Can we trace federal funding infrastructure to money spent in Chicago (i.e., Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA))? How can we get insight on the infrastructure spending patterns?

- Can documentation from https://chicago.documenters.org/ be leveraged to help us understand smaller changes?

### Who we're looking for
Right now, we have datasets and a lot of unknowns; this project is wide open to go in many directions, though at this stage I think we're looking to explore and be curious more than building anything.
If you have curiosity, you're the right person!

### Tools
I use python and polars for data exploration, though any other skills/tools are welcome and can plug in at this early stage.

### The Data we have
- [White House Report of investments in infrastructure](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Invest.gov_PublicInvestments_Map_Data_CURRENT.xlsx)
    - [The data as a web app](https://www.whitehouse.gov/invest/)
- [Chicago Building Permits data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Permits/ydr8-5enu/about_data)

### Where we meet
